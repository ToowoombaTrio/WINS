# WINS - crop stress *W*eather *IN*formation delivery *S*ystem

## About

WINS is an R-package constructed as a part of GovHack 2016.

The *WINS* project (formerly called
[*John_Conner*](https://github.com/ToowoombaTrio/John_Conner)) was
initiated by the Toowoomba Trio to tackle a major and growing problem
faced by Queensland vegetable growers. This challenge is identifying and
responding to heat stress in their crops. High temperatures can cause
considerable stress to crops, reducing yields and the quality of the
produce grown. However, if the stress is identified early enough
remedial action can be taken to minimise the damage and save the crop.
*WINS* provides a timely warning system for farmers when a heat stress
event has likely occurred. The *WINS* project is built in the R
environment, an open source statistical programing environment and
utilises Australia Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) weather data.

and works.

if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/") 
  library("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("ToowoombaTrio/WINS")
library("WINS")
```
